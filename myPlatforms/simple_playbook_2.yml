# This file will add users cmsuser and adminuser, their passwords and directory structures. It then adds your public
# key and adminuser to the list of sudoers. It then setups up the bashrc script for your users and has a task to setup
# the SSH server to stop root access. This part is not active at the time of writing.
# It requires that you have root access to the machine to run.
# 1) Run the setup.yml script
# To run:
# />  ansible-playbook setup.yml  --ask-pass
